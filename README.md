# Deep-learning-with-Pytorch-Siamese-Network
For certain problems like face recognition and signature verification, we can’t always rely on getting more data, to solve this kind of tasks we have a new type of neural network architecture called Siamese Networks.
A Siamese Neural Network is a class of neural network architectures that contain two or more identical subnetworks. ‘identical’ here means, they have the same configuration with the same parameters and weights.
Triplet loss is a loss function where a baseline (anchor) input is compared to a positive (truthy) input and a negative (falsy) input. The distance from the baseline (anchor) input to the positive (truthy) input is minimized, and the distance from the baseline (anchor) input to the negative (falsy) input is maximized.
